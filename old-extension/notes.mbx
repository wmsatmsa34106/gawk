Will do.

I started a new branch array-iface to fix/improve some issues with
the array interface. It has currently the following commits:

	New array extension.	
	Add optional shutdown routine for an extension lib.
	Improve array interface.
	Polish array handling code.
	Use unref when freeing a null array element.

Thr new array extension shows how to override default array
behavior, for example, to do deferred loading at run-time when
an array or array element is referred to. I was going to "improve"
slighly the similar mechanism available for scalars (update_FOO/set_FOO).
If any extension adds large number of variables into  the symbol
table but at a given moment the user only uses a few of them, this
could have saved a lot of unnecessary work. But, I don't know
if an extension can or should use these facilities with the new API.

I was also considering adding an example extension for persistent
arrays but ...

The unrelated change 'shutdown routine for extension' makes
gawk to run those when exiting normally or abnormally(fatal error). 

Please take a look at what I have there. I may have to rebase
this branch and I think I can remove anything not suitable
for inclusion.

Thanks,

John
